# Credits!!! Important
Before yall say I skidded this, credits to the discord token logger in advanced logger go to [the guy who made it](http://github.com/EnormousPotato).
# Roblox-Cookie-Logger
This is a project i have made. It should work and i need some feedback. If it works, please open an issue and tell it to me because i am very unsure of my programming skills.
# How To Use
First of all, you will need to install the following pips: pip install colorama, requests, browser_cookie3 (if you dont know how just go to the folder with the files and type cmd in the navigation bar). Then you would like to get your webhooks and convert it into base32 (safer from crackers). Finally, you just paste it into the space where it says 'key = "PASTE THE HOOK HERE"' Then just compile with pyinstaller (I prefer [nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)) and kaboom. Good luck beamers!
# Plans 
Idk i might update it. I am planning on making this look like a limited sniper or an exploit (idk just playing aroud)
